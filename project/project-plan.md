# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Electric Car adoption on CO2 emission and motor fuel consumption/sales.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does Elecritc Car adoption have a significanrt imact on air pollution?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Air pollution is an important problem in big cities. In this project we analyze the relation between electric car adoption and air quality in Washington State and in particular in it's major cities. We also investigate the trend of motor fuel sales.
